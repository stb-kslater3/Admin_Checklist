Once The Admin is Chosen:
    Query for this Admins data:
        Go ahead and fill in the Descriptions.

        . . .

        Query for an Opportunity with this Admin:
            if(No Opportunity) {
                Go ahead and fill in what would have been those Opportunity fields with the AdminChecklist data.
            }else if(More than 1) {
                . . .
            }else {
                Query for Products:
                    if(Products) {
                        if(there is a Chassis) {
                            fill out chassis_year, vin, etc.
                        }

                        if(there is a body) {
                            fill out body series name
                        }

                        Query for POs, then:
                            for each PO Line:
                                if(this po has a value for Cost) {
                                    use the po value for cost
                                }else {
                                    if(This is a product and it has a value then use that) {

                                    }else {
                                        use what was entered on the Admin.
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                    }

                    . . .
            }


            DATA FILLED IN DOWN HERE AND JUST DETERMINING WHAT OUR CASES ARE UP ABOVE
            - That is, I would like to avoid double entering the data logic. For example in any case the Descriptions are coming
            from the Admin, but I don't want to do that for each if Case, instead I figure out . . .
